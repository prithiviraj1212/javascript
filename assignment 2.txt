1.console.log()
     The console.log() is a function in js which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed
   console.warn()
      The console.warn() method is used to write a warning message in the console. So open the console to display the output (warning message).


2.diff b/w var const and let

    var-

         The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
eg;
      var tester = "hey hi";
    
    function newFunction() {
        var hello = "hello";
    }
    console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined

    var variables can be redeclared.VAR are locally/globally scoped

LET-
        let is block scoped
A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within curly braces is a block.

eg;
        let greeting = "say Hi";
   let times = 4;

   if (times > 3) {
        let hello = "say Hello instead";
        console.log(hello);// "say Hello instead"
    }
   console.log(hello) // hello is not defined

let can be updated but not re-declared.


CONST
            Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.

const declarations are block scoped
Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.

const cannot be updated or re-declared

EG:

     const greeting = "say Hi";
    greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Assignment to constant variable. 


3.Datatyps in JS

         JavaScript Strings:

A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "prithiv".

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes.

        JavaScript Numbers:

JavaScript has only one type of numbers.

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.

       JavaScript Booleans:
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

       JavaScript Arrays:
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

      JavaScript Objects:
JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

     Undefined:
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.

    Null:
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.

Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
